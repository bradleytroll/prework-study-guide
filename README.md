# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This guide serves to lead students through the opening concepts of coding bootcamp. The single-page application was built to provide a brief overview of topics and allow students to track their learning. By building this application, I learned the basic langauge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as a few techniques for saving and deploying my work using GitHub.

## Usage

This application can be used to track learning by using the note-taking feature. Notes have been divided into four topics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. While using keep the DevTools console open in your browser to see the JavaScript running in real time, which will list the prework topics and randomly choose a topic to study first.
